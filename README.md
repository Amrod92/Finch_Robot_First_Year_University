# Throwback Finch Robot - Brunel University London Project ðŸ¦…

This is a little throwback when I was studying at Brunel University London on my first year. As a final year project, I had to implement a little software using Java language, the user would use a command line to select which shape to draw (triangle and rectangle) and create a validation to confirm the right parameters. This project helped me to better understand OOP concepts, troubleshoot using Google, StackOverflow and read the Java documentation, which could be quite overwhelming at first.
